# hello-world

## My first public repository; a place to practice using git and github

## Lesson 1: Cloning, Branches, Pushes

I created the **hello-world** repo on github and cloned it to my local system.
I then used the git branch command to make a new branch for editing this readme on my local system.
After that I used the git checkout command to swap to the new branch.
I edited the readme document and committed the changes before pushing the entire new branch to the remote repo on github.

## Lesson 2: Pull Requests

I used the **GitHub** gui to open a pull request, leave a comment, inspect the pull request, and then merge the pull request.
