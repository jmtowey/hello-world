# hello-world

## My first public repository; a place to practice using git and github

I am a student in the social sciences who loves computational methods of analysis. I am a sociologist currently looking at social structure effects in financial markets. Though I am not new to social science or computational methods, I am new to **GitHub** and learning as I go. Please excuse me for any mistakes a more seasoned user would not make--and any they *would*, if you don't mind.

## Lesson 1: Cloning, Branches, Pushes

I created the **hello-world** repo on github and cloned it to my local system.
I then used the git branch command to make a new branch for editing this readme on my local system.
After that I used the git checkout command to swap to the new branch.
I edited the readme document and committed the changes before pushing the entire new branch to the remote repo on github.

## Lesson 2: Pull Requests

I used the **GitHub** gui to open a pull request, leave a comment, inspect the pull request, and then merge the pull request.

Back on my local machine, I switched back to the main branch. To my surprise, though, I found the file looking as it had before I edited it the first time. I tried *git pull* and watched the file, open in an editor, change before my eyes. What an amazing technology.

After that I began adding the experience to the README file. I realized I was editing on the main branch and quickly input git restore README.md. I watched the open README file revert to its prior state and switched back to the edit branch.

## Next Steps

* Forking Repositories
* Being social
* Starting my own open source project
