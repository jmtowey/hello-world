# hello-world
## My first public repository; a place to practice using git and github

## Lesson 1: Cloning, Branches, & Pulls
I created the **hello-world** repo on github and cloned it to my local system.
I then used the git branch command to make a new branch for editing this readme.
After that I used the git checkout command to swap to the new branch.
I edited the readme document and committed the changes before openning a pull request.
